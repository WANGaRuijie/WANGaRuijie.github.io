I come from Changsha, Hunan, China. I am a third-year undergraduate student at the [Department of Computing](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/comp), the [Hong Kong Polytechnic University](https://www.polyu.edu.hk), where I am majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Applied Mathematics at the [Department of Applied Mathematics](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/ama/). During the summer of 2023, I was an exchange student at the [Technical University of Denmark](https://www.dtu.dk/). With enthusiasm to experiment with unfamiliar areas of Computer Science, I am broadly interested in the interdisciplinary fields of Theoretical Computer Science, Computer Systems, Computer Engineering, Machine Learning, Economics, and Finance, where I am currently engaged in Algorithmic Game Theory. I have been an undergraduate researcher focusing on the fair allocation problem in Algorithmic Game Theory since April 2023, and it is my fortune to be advised by [Dr. Bo Li](https://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~bo2li/). Before that, I enjoyed my time at the [Yali High School (learn more from the Yale-China Association)](https://www.yalechina.org/who-we-are), Changsha. 

My vision for the future is to be a computer scientist working with originality and impact. I am addicted to badminton, and I usually enjoy my spare time by going hiking. I am also passionate about traveling, and my destinations overseas include Germany (Berlin, Hamburg, Leipzig, and Lübeck), Sweden (Malmö), the United States (Los Angels, San Francisco, Las Vegas, Santa Barbara, and San Jose), Vietnam (Da Nang), and Thailand (Bangkok and Pattaya).
