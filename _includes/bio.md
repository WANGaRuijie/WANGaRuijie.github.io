I am currently a year-2 undergraduate student at the [Department of Computing](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/comp), [the Hong Kong Polytechnic University](https://www.polyu.edu.hk), where I am majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Applied Mathematics at the [Department of Applied Mathematics](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/ama/). I am broadly interested in Theoretical Computer Science and the interdisciplinary areas of Computer Science, Economics and Finance, especially for Algorithmic Game Theory, Mechanism Design and Algorithmic Trading. Prior to that, I enjoyed my time at the [Yali High School (learn more from the Yale-China Association)](https://www.yalechina.org/who-we-are), Changsha.
