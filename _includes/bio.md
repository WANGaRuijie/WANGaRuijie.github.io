I am a junior undergraduate student at the [Department of Computing](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/comp), [Hong Kong Polytechnic University](https://www.polyu.edu.hk) majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Applied Mathematics. In Summer 2023, I was an exchange student at [Technical University of Denmark](https://www.dtu.dk/). I also enjoyed my time at [Yali High School](https://www.yalechina.org/who-we-are) from 2019 to 2022. 

My research interests center on theoretical computer science. Specifically, I am curious about the novel problems in **(1) economic mechanisms**, **(2) interpretability and effectiveness of machine learning**, **(3) blockchains, privacy, and security** from both (1) theoretical (game theory, learning theory, cryptography, complexity, randomized/distributed/concurrent algorithms and data structures, etc.) and (2) logical/systematic (formal methods, programming language design, automated reasoning, program analysis, etc.) perspectives. I summarize them as **<span style="color: #273C83;"> what profound insights we can obtain from the synergy among different Theoretical Computer Science branches, and for which class of problems the art of formal methods carry equal weight with the science of algorithm design and complexity analysis</span>**

It is my great fortune to be advised by [Prof. Li Bo](https://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~bo2li/) and Dr. Sun Ankang on the fair allocation problem of indivisible items since my second year in college. Currently, I am a research intern at [Simon Fraser University](https://www.sfu.ca) working on SQL program synthesis for vector databases, mentored by [Prof. Wang Yuepeng](https://www.cs.sfu.ca/~yuepeng/) with the Mitacs Gloabalink Research Internship Award.

I spent my beautiful younger years in Changsha, the capital city of Hunan. I am addicted to playing badminton (doubles), and I am also passionate about video games, traveling, cycling, and hiking to fulfill my spare time, and passionate about classical Chinese poetry. Recently, I have thought a lot about the exam-oriented education system and education in Computer Science.
