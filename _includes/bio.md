I come from Changsha, Hunan, China. I am a third-year undergraduate student at the [Department of Computing](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/comp), the [Hong Kong Polytechnic University](https://www.polyu.edu.hk), where I am majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Applied Mathematics at the [Department of Applied Mathematics](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/ama/). In the summer 2023, I was an exchange student at the [Technical University of Denmark](https://www.dtu.dk/). I enjoyed my time at the [Yali High School](https://www.yalechina.org/who-we-are), Changsha. 

I am interested in theoretical computer science and programming languages. It is my fortune to be advised by [Dr. Bo Li](https://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~bo2li/) as an undergraduate research assistant focusing on the fair division problem in algorithmic game theory. I will start my research intern on programming languages at the [Simon Fraser University](https://www.sfu.ca/) in May 2025.   

My vision is to be a computer scientist working with originality and impact. I am addicted to badminton, and I usually enjoy my spare time by going hiking or citywalk. I am also passionate about traveling, and my past destinations overseas include Germany (Berlin, Hamburg, Leipzig, and Lübeck), Sweden (Malmö), the United States (Los Angels, San Francisco, Las Vegas, Santa Barbara, and San Jose), Vietnam (Da Nang), and Thailand (Bangkok and Pattaya).
