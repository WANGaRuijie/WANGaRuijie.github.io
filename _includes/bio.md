I am currently a year-2 undergraduate student at the [Department of Computing](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/comp), the [Hong Kong Polytechnic University](https://www.polyu.edu.hk), where I am majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Applied Mathematics at the [Department of Applied Mathematics](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/ama/). During the summer 2023, I was an exchange student at the [Technical University of Denmark](https://www.dtu.dk/). I am broadly interested in Theoretical Computer Science and the interdisciplinary areas of Computer Science, Economics and Finance, especially for Algorithmic Game Theory, Mechanism Design and Algorithmic Trading, and it is my fortune to receive advice from [Dr. Bo Li](https://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~bo2li/). Prior to that, I enjoyed my time at the [Yali High School (learn more from the Yale-China Association)](https://www.yalechina.org/who-we-are), Changsha.
