My Chinese name is 王睿杰. I come from Changsha, Hunan, China. I am currently a third-year undergraduate student at the [Department of Computing](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/comp), the [Hong Kong Polytechnic University](https://www.polyu.edu.hk), where I am majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Applied Mathematics at the [Department of Applied Mathematics](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/ama/). During the summer of 2023, I was an exchange student at the [Technical University of Denmark](https://www.dtu.dk/). I am broadly interested in the interdisciplinary areas of Theoretical Computer Science, Machine Learning, Economics, and Finance, especially for Algorithmic Game Theory, Algorithmic Trading, and Learning Theory. I have been an undergraduate researcher on the fair allocation problem in Algorithmic Game Theory since April 2023, and it is my fortune to be advised by [Dr. Bo Li](https://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~bo2li/). Before that, I enjoyed my time at the [Yali High School (learn more from the Yale-China Association)](https://www.yalechina.org/who-we-are), Changsha. In my spare time, I usually play badminton or go for a short hike.
