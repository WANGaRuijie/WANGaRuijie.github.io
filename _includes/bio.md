I am now a junior undergraduate student at the [Department of Computing](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/comp), [Hong Kong Polytechnic University](https://www.polyu.edu.hk) majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Applied Mathematics. In Summer 2023, I was an exchange student at [Technical University of Denmark](https://www.dtu.dk/). I also enjoyed my time at [Yali High School](https://www.yalechina.org/who-we-are) from 2019 to 2022. 

My research interests center on theoretical computer science. Specifically, I am working on algorithmic game theory and formal methods. I am always curious about all kinds of algorithms, complexity theory, programming language and automata theory, cryptography, machine learning theory, data structures and algorithm engineering, or any problem in computer science that is on the borderline among theory, system, and application. It is my great fortune to be advised by [Prof. Li Bo](https://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~bo2li/) and Dr. Sun Ankang on the fair allocation problem of indivisible items since my second year in college. Currently, I am a research intern at [Simon Fraser University](https://www.sfu.ca) working on SQL program synthesis for vector databases, mentored by [Prof. Yuepeng Wang](https://www.cs.sfu.ca/~yuepeng/), and supported by Mitacs Gloaballink Research Internship Award.

I spent my beautiful younger years in Changsha, the captital city of Hunan. I am addicted to playing badminton, and I am also passionate about video games, traveling, cycling, and hiking to fulfill my spare time.
