Hi there! I am a senior undergraduate student at the [Department of Computing](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/comp), [Hong Kong Polytechnic University](https://www.polyu.edu.hk) majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Applied Mathematics. I enjoyed my time at [Yali High School](https://www.yalechina.org/who-we-are) from 2019 to 2022. 

**I am attracted by (1) the expansion of economics by computability** and **(2) the economic characterization of the emerging applications of computer science.** For example, in **(1)**, algorithms are introduced to compute the fair division of a cake; in **(2)**, auctions are involved in the design of cryptocurrencies, and game theory is referred to model the problems in privacy, machine learning, and multi-agent systems. My research interests center on these two aspects of the interplay of (theoretical) computer science and economics known as **Economics and Computation**. I am also interested in Formal Methods and the Foundation and Interpretability of Machine Learning.

*<span style="color: #326DF4;">I wonder what insight we could obtain from the synergy among economics, data science, political science, artificial intelligence, and different branches of (theoretical) computer science. **Calculemus!**</span>*

It is my great fortune to be advised by [Prof. Li Bo](https://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~bo2li/) and Dr. Sun Ankang on the fair allocation problem of indivisible items as my first attempt of research. We wrote a paper about the different versions of proportional and equitable orientations on simple graphs and multigraphs. I was a summer research intern at [Simon Fraser University](https://www.sfu.ca) working on SQL program synthesis for vector databases in Summer 2025, mentored by [Prof. Wang Yuepeng](https://www.cs.sfu.ca/~yuepeng/) and funded by the Mitacs Gloabalink Research Internship Award. During Summer 2023, I was an exchange student at [Technical University of Denmark](https://www.dtu.dk/).

I spent my beautiful younger years in Changsha, Hunan before I was 18 when I left my home for the greater world. I am addicted to playing badminton (doubles), and I am also passionate about video games (World of Warships, Minecraft, etc.), hiking in mountains, and exploring the city corners to fulfill my spare time (citywalk). I can not forget the beauty of the classical (some modern) Chinese literature.

Should you require any further information or just want to chat, please feel free to contact me via ruijie.wang@connect.polyu.hk or visit my LinkedIn and GitHub pages. I am there to help if you believe I can give you a hand.
