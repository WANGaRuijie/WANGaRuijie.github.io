I am a junior undergraduate student at the [Department of Computing](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/comp), [Hong Kong Polytechnic University](https://www.polyu.edu.hk) majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Applied Mathematics. In Summer 2023, I was an exchange student at [Technical University of Denmark](https://www.dtu.dk/). I also enjoyed my time at [Yali High School](https://www.yalechina.org/who-we-are) from 2019 to 2022. 

My research interests center on theoretical computer science. Specifically, I am curious about the novel problems in **(1) game theory and economic mechanism design, (2) theoretical foundations of machine learning, (3) privacy, security, and blockchain, and (4) program synthesis and formal verification** from interleaving perspectives. 

*<span style="color: #326DF4;">I wonder what insights we can obtain from the synergy among the different branches of theoretical computer science (TCS track A + track B + applications).</span>*

It is my great fortune to be advised by [Prof. Li Bo](https://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~bo2li/) and Dr. Sun Ankang on the fair allocation problem of indivisible items since my second year in college. Currently, I am a research intern at [Simon Fraser University](https://www.sfu.ca) working on SQL program synthesis for vector databases, mentored by [Prof. Wang Yuepeng](https://www.cs.sfu.ca/~yuepeng/) with the Mitacs Gloabalink Research Internship Award.

I spent my beautiful younger years in Changsha, the capital city of Hunan. I am addicted to playing badminton (doubles), and I am also passionate about video games, traveling, cycling, and hiking to fulfill my spare time, and passionate about classical Chinese poetry. Recently, I have thought a lot about the exam-oriented education system and education in Computer Science.
