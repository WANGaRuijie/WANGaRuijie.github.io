I am a senior undergraduate student at the [Department of Computing](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/comp), [Hong Kong Polytechnic University](https://www.polyu.edu.hk) majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Applied Mathematics. I enjoyed my time at [Yali High School](https://www.yalechina.org/who-we-are) from 2019 to 2022. 

My research interest centers on giving theoretical characterizations for the emerging problems in computer science. I am particularly excited about algorithmic economics and its interplay with the topics in theoretical computer science and data science, which includes but not limited to **(1) algorithm design for fair division, (2) mechanism design for privacy, blockchain, applied cryptography, online markets, and machine learning (3) learning theory and game theory, (4) formal methods and automated programming for complex algorithms, and (5) computer science toolkit for public policy and social science**. 

*<span style="color: #326DF4;">I wonder what insights we can obtain from the synergy among data science, economics, social science, and the different tracks of theoretical computer science.</span>*

It is my great fortune to be advised by [Prof. Li Bo](https://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~bo2li/) and Dr. Sun Ankang on the fair allocation problem of indivisible items as my first attempt of research. I was a summer research intern at [Simon Fraser University](https://www.sfu.ca) working on SQL program synthesis for vector databases in Summer 2025, mentored by [Prof. Wang Yuepeng](https://www.cs.sfu.ca/~yuepeng/) and funded by the Mitacs Gloabalink Research Internship Award. During Summer 2023, I was an exchange student at [Technical University of Denmark](https://www.dtu.dk/).

I spent my beautiful younger years in Changsha, the capital city of Hunan. I am addicted to playing badminton (doubles), and I am also passionate about video games, traveling, cycling, and hiking to fulfill my spare time, and passionate about classical Chinese poetry. Recently, I have thought a lot about the exam-oriented education system and education in Computer Science.
