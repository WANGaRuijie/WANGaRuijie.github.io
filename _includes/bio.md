I am a third-year undergraduate student at the [Department of Computing](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/comp), the [Hong Kong Polytechnic University](https://www.polyu.edu.hk), where I am majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Applied Mathematics. In the summer of 2023, I was an exchange student at the [Technical University of Denmark](https://www.dtu.dk/). I also enjoyed my time at the [Yali High School](https://www.yalechina.org/who-we-are). 

My research interests center on theoretical computer science. Specifically, I am interested in algorithmic game theory, formal methods, programming languages, cryptography, machine learning theory, or any problem in computer science that is on the borderline between theory and application. It is my great fortune to be advised by [Prof. Li Bo](https://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~bo2li/) and Dr. Sun Ankang on the fair allocation problem in algorithmic game theory since my second year in college.  

I spent my younger years in Changsha, the captital city of Hunan. I am addicted to badminton, and I am also passionate about traveling, cycling, and going hiking once I get any spare time.
