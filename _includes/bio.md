I come from Changsha, Hunan, China. I am currently a third-year undergraduate student at the [Department of Computing](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/comp), the [Hong Kong Polytechnic University](https://www.polyu.edu.hk), where I am majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Applied Mathematics at the [Department of Applied Mathematics](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/ama/). During the summer of 2023, I was an exchange student at the [Technical University of Denmark](https://www.dtu.dk/).With sustainable enthusiasm to experiment with unfamiliar areas, I am broadly interested in the interdisciplinary fields of Theoretical Computer Science, Computer Systems, Computer Engineering, Machine Learning, Economics, and Finance, and I am also familiar with Algorihmic Game Theory. I have been an undergraduate researcher focusing on the fair allocation problem in Algorithmic Game Theory since April 2023, and it is my fortune to be advised by [Dr. Bo Li](https://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~bo2li/). Before that, I enjoyed my time at the [Yali High School (learn more from the Yale-China Association)](https://www.yalechina.org/who-we-are), Changsha. 

My future vision is to become a computer scientist working with originality and impact. I am addicted to badminton, and I usually enjoy my spare time by going hiking. I have been to Denmark (Copenhagen), Germany (Berlin, Hamburg，Leipizig, and Lübeck), Sweden (Malmö), the United States (Los Angels, San Francisco, Las Vegas, Santa Barbara, and San Jose), Vietnam (Da Nang), and Thailand (Bangkok and Pattaya).
