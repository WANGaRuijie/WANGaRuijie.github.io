Fair division is an important problem in algorithmic game theory, which has received considerable attention in recent years.
In this paper, we focus on an orientation setting where each agent is restricted to receiving items from a specific subset, referred to as their relevant items. 
The relevance restriction represents a natural constraint in real-world applications and generalizes the classical unconstrained setting. 
While the orientation setting has been widely studied, existing work has concentrated on envy-freeness. 
In this paper, we initiate the study of other important fairness concepts such as proportionality, equitability, and their relaxations.
We present a comprehensive set of computational results for the allocation of goods, chores, and mixed manna.
In particular, for each fairness concept, we consider the computational complexity of deciding the existence of a fair allocation, and the extent to which it can be satisfied and efficiently computed.
